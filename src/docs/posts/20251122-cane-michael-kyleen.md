### A. Dynamic Associates Corporate Lineage Narrative

Dynamic Associates Inc. (CIK 0000878146) was incorporated in Nevada on November 18, 1996, and served as the parent company for a multi-state healthcare and medical device enterprise.[^1] Led by President and CEO Jan Wallace (CIK 0001286757), the company raised approximately $8.6 million in documented capital and claimed a market capitalization of $70 million.[^1] The company's subsidiaries included P&H Industries (California manufacturing), Microthermia Inc. (San Jose medical device technology), and Genesis Health Management (operating 32 rural hospitals across 7 states).[^1]

On June 12, 2001, Dynamic Associates underwent a reverse merger with Tele-Lawyer Inc., a private legal services and technology company founded in May 1989 by Michael A. Cane.[^2][^3] The transaction included a 153\:1 reverse stock split, resulting in 99.3% dilution of existing shareholders.[^2] Following the merger, the entity operated as Legal Access Technologies, Inc. (LAT), retaining the original CIK 0000878146.[^2] Michael A. Cane (who later changed their name to Kyleen E Cane on 6/28/2001)[^6] served as CEO of the newly formed entity and acquired 2,821,051 shares representing 48.7% ownership through an IRC §368(a)(1)(A) share-for-share merger exchange on June 18, 2001.[^8] Kyleen Cane subsequently served as CEO, CFO, and President of Legal Access Technologies during 2003-2004.[^12] The entity was eventually terminated on August 30, 2006, through a Form 15-12G voluntary deregistration.[^13]

On March 11, 1998, Dynamic Associates spun off MW Medical, Inc. (CIK 0001059577) in a 1\:1 distribution to Dynamic shareholders.[^15] MW Medical was incorporated in Nevada on December 4, 1997, with business operations focused on electromedical and electrotherapeutic apparatus.[^14] Jan Wallace served as President and CEO of MW Medical from 1999 through 2004, while Michael A. Cane (later Kyleen Cane) served as legal counsel.[^16][^17] The company completed an S-1 registration on September 3, 1999, offering 5,146,010 shares at $3.50 per share, raising $9 million in documented capital.[^18]

MW Medical filed for bankruptcy on January 22, 2002, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Arizona (Case No. 02-10145), later transferred to the District of Nevada.[^21] Jan Wallace held the position of sole secured creditor with $615,871+ in promissory notes secured by all company assets in first-priority position.[^22] The bankruptcy plan created five subsidiary entities with ownership distributed to wage claimants and unsecured creditors: MW Asia/NW Asia (95% to Grace Sim), MW Europe (95% to Dean Drummond), MW South America/NW South America (95% to Tyler Brown), MW Fitness (95% to Jan Wallace), and Microwave Debtor (95% to Jan Wallace).[^23] A contract for the sale of the MW Asia shell to Beardmore for $250,000 was executed on December 6, 2002.[^24]

MW Medical emerged from bankruptcy on June 24, 2004, simultaneously changing its name to Davi Skin Inc.[^25] The reorganized entity operated in the skincare and cosmetics business with Jan Wallace serving as CEO and Kyleen Cane serving as Director.[^26] Civil litigation (Parrish Medley v. Jan Wallace) was filed against the company on April 21, 2006.[^27] The SEC ultimately revoked Davi Skin Inc.'s registration on August 27, 2012, for failure to file required reports.[^28]

### B. Unregistered Securities: Dynamic Associates → Davi Skin

This section examines the potential mechanisms by which shareholders of Dynamic Associates Inc. or its spun-off subsidiaries could convert historical share certificates into securities of successor entities such as Davi Skin Inc.

The conversion of shares from earlier entities (Dynamic Associates, Legal Access Technologies, MW Medical) to later entities (such as Davi Skin) would typically involve a multi-step process coordinated through legal and transfer agent services. Based on standard securities practice and the corporate structures documented in SEC filings, the likely conversion pathway would involve:

**1. Share Certificate Issuance and Physical Transfer:** Original shareholders of Dynamic Associates or its subsidiaries would present physical share certificates or electronic book-entry positions. These certificates, representing equity in the predecessor entities, would be transferred to a securities intermediary or legal opinion provider, such as a law firm specializing in securities matters (e.g., firms like Cane Clark LLP, which served as legal advisor and investment entity in related transactions).[^29]

**2. Legal Opinion Letter Preparation:** A securities attorney would prepare a legal opinion letter addressing the legitimacy of the share ownership, the corporate actions connecting the predecessor entity to the successor entity, and the basis for removing restrictive legends under Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions. This opinion letter would:
- Document the chain of corporate events (spin-off from Dynamic Associates to MW Medical on 3/11/1998,[^15] name change from MW Medical to Davi Skin on 6/24/2004)[^25]
- Certify that shares were originally issued in compliance with applicable securities laws
- Provide legal justification for the removal of restrictive legends (e.g., "restricted securities" or Rule 144 holding period satisfaction)
- Establish that the shares qualify as "free trading" under applicable SEC regulations

**3. Transfer Agent Processing:** The opinion letter, together with supporting documentation (corporate action records, share certificates, SEC filing confirmations), would be submitted to the transfer agent for the successor entity (Davi Skin Inc.). The transfer agent would:
- Verify the legitimacy of the predecessor shares
- Confirm the corporate lineage and any applicable conversion ratios (such as the 153:1 reverse split in the Dynamic Associates/Legal Access Technologies merger)[^2]
- Issue new share certificates or book-entry positions in the successor entity
- Remove restrictive legends to create "free trading" shares

**4. Market Distribution:** Once the shares were converted and the restrictive legends removed, the shareholders would hold unrestricted, freely tradable securities in Davi Skin Inc. These shares could then be sold through broker-dealers in the public market, subject to any applicable holding periods or volume limitations under Rule 144.

**Key Corporate Events Enabling Conversion:**

- **3/11/1998:** MW Medical spun off from Dynamic Associates in 1:1 distribution to shareholders[^15]
- **6/12/2001:** Dynamic Associates reverse merged with Tele-Lawyer Inc., becoming Legal Access Technologies[^2]
- **6/24/2004:** MW Medical emerged from bankruptcy and changed name to Davi Skin Inc.[^25]

The conversion process would necessarily involve legal counsel (such as Michael A. Cane/Kyleen Cane, who served as legal counsel to MW Medical[^17] and later as Director of Davi Skin Inc.)[^26] to provide opinion letters establishing the legitimacy of share conversion and the removal of restrictive legends. The presence of Kyleen Cane in multiple roles—legal counsel to MW Medical, director of Davi Skin, CEO of Legal Access Technologies, and director of Las Vegas Gaming—suggests a coordinated legal and corporate structure facilitating such conversions across related entities.

Without direct documentary evidence of specific conversion transactions, this narrative describes the standard securities practice mechanism that would enable shareholders of predecessor entities to obtain freely tradable shares in successor entities through legally compliant opinion letter processes.

#### Narrative Summary of Financial Relationship

The financial relationship between Kyleen Cane and Jan Wallace spans 15 years (1997-2012) across nine corporate entities, evolving from attorney-client relationships to direct business partnerships and overlapping corporate officer positions.

**Phase 1: Attorney-Client Relationship (1997-2001):** Michael A. Cane (later Kyleen Cane) served as legal counsel to Jan Wallace in multiple capacities. Cane provided legal services to MW Medical Inc. beginning in 1999,[^17] while Wallace served as President and CEO.[^16] Cane also provided legal counsel to Dynamic Associates Inc., where Wallace served as President and CEO. This attorney-client relationship established the foundation for subsequent business transactions.

**Phase 2: Reverse Merger and Entity Succession (2001):** On June 12, 2001, Michael A. Cane's private company, Tele-Lawyer Inc. (founded May 1989),[^3] completed a reverse merger with Jan Wallace's Dynamic Associates Inc.[^2] This transaction represented a transition from attorney-client relationship to direct business partnership, with Cane acquiring 48.7% ownership (2,821,051 shares) of the successor entity, Legal Access Technologies, through an IRC §368(a)(1)(A) reorganization.[^8] The name change from Michael A. Cane to Kyleen E Cane occurred on June 28, 2001,[^6] sixteen days after the reverse merger closed.

**Phase 3: MW Medical Bankruptcy and Shared Corporate Control (2002-2004):** During MW Medical's bankruptcy (filed 1/22/2002),[^21] Jan Wallace held the position of sole secured creditor with $615,871+ secured by all company assets,[^22] while also serving as President and CEO.[^16] Wallace acquired 74,000,000 shares at $0.005 on March 26, 2003,[^20] during the bankruptcy reorganization. When MW Medical emerged from bankruptcy as Davi Skin Inc. on June 24, 2004,[^25] both Wallace and Cane held simultaneous officer positions: Wallace as CEO and Kyleen Cane as Director.[^26] This marked the first instance of direct shared corporate governance between the two individuals.

**Phase 4: Parallel Equity Holdings and Continued Collaboration (2003-2010):** During this period, Cane and Wallace maintained parallel equity positions in separate but related entities. Kyleen Cane served as Director of Las Vegas Gaming Inc. from 2005-2010,[^40] while the 2003 merger with Triple Win in Nevada was facilitated by legal services from Cane O'Neill Taylor, LLC.[^34] Simultaneously, Jan Wallace acquired 400,000 shares and 400,000 warrants in Secured Diversified Investment (later Galaxy Gaming) between April and December 2005,[^32][^33] while Kyleen Cane acquired positions in Las Vegas Gaming during overlapping timeframes (2005-2009).[^36][^37][^38][^39]

**Phase 5: Cane Clark LLP Investment Activities (2005+):** Kyleen Cane's law firm and investment entity, Cane Clark LLP (CIK 0001255294), acquired control of Sedona Software Solutions, Inc. (a shell company with market value of $138) on May 13, 2005.[^29] This acquisition demonstrated Cane's expanded role beyond legal counsel into direct investment and corporate control activities.

The cumulative record demonstrates a sustained financial relationship characterized by evolving roles: from attorney-client (1997-2001), to merger counterparties (2001), to co-officers in the same entity (2004-2012), alongside parallel equity holdings in related corporate structures. The relationship persisted through multiple corporate bankruptcies, reorganizations, name changes, and ultimately SEC registration revocations.

## IV. Documentary Evidence

The SEC EDGAR database contains multiple filings that document the name change event and provide corroborating evidence for the identity continuity between Michael A. Cane and Kyleen E Cane under Kyleen Cane (CIK 0001144030).

### A. Critical Name Change Documents

**Primary Evidence Document:**

[SEC Form 4, Las Vegas Gaming Inc. (CIK 0001103993), filed 10/13/2005, filing 0001255294-05-000636](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1103993/000125529405000636/0001255294-05-000636.txt).[^36]

This Form 4 filing contains explicit name change disclosure in the header section of the document:

> "REPORTING-OWNER:
>
> OWNER DATA:
> COMPANY CONFORMED NAME: CANE KYLEEN E
> CENTRAL INDEX KEY: 0001144030
>
> FILING VALUES:
> FORM TYPE: 4
>
> FORMER NAME: CANE MICHAEL A
> DATE OF NAME CHANGE: 20010628"

The document establishes three critical facts: (1) the current reporting identity is Kyleen E Cane, (2) the former name was Michael A Cane, and (3) the date of name change was June 28, 2001 (20010628). This filing represents the first SEC document to explicitly disclose all three data points in a single filing.

**Final Pre-Change Filing:**

[SEC Schedule 13D, Legal Access Technologies Inc. (CIK 0000878146), filed 6/28/2001, filing 0001075793-01-500095](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/878146/000107579301500095/0001075793-01-500095.txt).[^8]

This SC 13D filing represents the last document filed under the name of Michael A. Cane. The filing header identifies:

> "FILED BY:
> MICHAEL A. CANE
> CENTRAL INDEX KEY: 0001144030"

The document reports the acquisition of 2,821,051 shares (48.7% ownership) of Legal Access Technologies Inc. through a share-for-share merger exchange qualifying as an IRC §368(a)(1)(A) reorganization, with an event date of June 18, 2001, and filing date of June 28, 2001 (20010628).

The significance of this document is that it was filed on the exact date of the name change (6/28/2001), represents the final use of the name Michael A. Cane in SEC filings, and documents the largest single equity acquisition by the individual across all analyzed transactions.

### B. Complete Document Inventory
